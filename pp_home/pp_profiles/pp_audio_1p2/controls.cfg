# The default symbolic name that is bound to an internal operation can be changed for a top level show and all its child/subshows by specifying a new symbolic name for the function in the controls field of the top level show.
#
# The function can also be disabled by binding the symbolic name to null

# You can add additional operations here and bind them to symbolic names.
# The operations are run-time controls of omxplayer and mplayer.
# The operations must be a single character preceed by omx- or mplay-
